# Fractal

The C# code that is included in the 'fractal' repository allows the user to run the GUI that generates the fractal, as well as customize it to their liking.

## Note

The project was written on Windows, and therefore is formatted to run from Microsoft's Visual Studio. If wanted to be run on the Mac OS, the .csproj file needs to be replaced with a .json file.
